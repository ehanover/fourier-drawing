# Fourier Drawing
## [Try out this project!](http://ehanover.github.io/fourier-drawing)

I watched [this video](https://youtu.be/r6sGWTCMz2k) by 3Blue1Brown about the Fourier series and was inspired to create my own tool that generated animations like his. The conversion from a simple shape to a bunch of spinning circles is amazing. 

I will confess to not totally understanding the math behind this but somehow I managed to make it work.

### Extensions
* Draw a continuous path between the points
* Add arrows to the circles during the animation
* Allow changing the resolution slider during the animation
